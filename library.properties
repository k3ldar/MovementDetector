sentence=High-level movement detection and state tracking using ultrasonic distance sensors like HC-SR04.
paragraph=The MovementDetector library extends HC-SR04 functionality with intelligent motion analysis. It detects movement direction (FORWARD/BACKWARD), classifies movement states (IDLE, MOVED, STOPPED, DANGERCLOSE, OUTOFRANGE), and supports event-driven callbacks for changes in movement state. Includes stability checks, baseline calibration, and configurable thresholds to reduce noise and false positives. Ideal for interactive installations, automation, and security applications.
